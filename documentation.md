Documentation
=============

Replace the README
------------------

First thing you should do with your exercises is replace the README with your own. It should describe what your code does, why it does it and how to use it.

Provide Good Examples
---------------------

Without good examples, only the most dedicated and desparate users are going to make use of your library. We need good examples to know how to use your tools. Greg wrote an [excellent Practicing Ruby article](http://practicingruby.com/articles/shared/zbffwcmcltkw) last week that covers this topic. Take the time to read it and write your own great examples for your Personal Project and exercises.
