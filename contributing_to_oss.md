Contributing to OSS
===================

Be Thoughtful
-------------

When coming into someone else's project, be thoughtful. Don't add new testing/environmental dependencies within a functional commit. Make your changes using the current dependencies. If you cannot accomplish this without adding new dependencies, then talk to the maintainer. Get their input on how you should proceed and act accordingly.
